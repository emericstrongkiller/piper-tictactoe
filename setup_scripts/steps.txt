- make a simple node that creates a topic called : /piper_move_order with two floats (position, shape)
- make X_trajectory thing subscribe to this topic (executor shit and things   to verify)
- add the registered positions from step 2.4 into the X_trajectory.cpp 
- add a step to look the value in /piper_move_order and go to the specified position before doing cross or circle depending on /piper_move_order[shape]
- loop this in X_traj thing
- add in X_traj a publisher to /piper_move_response with a boolean to tell the other node when its done with the move
- make the simple Cpp node check when the guy is done and print something in the logs when its done.
