- Find a way to analyse this pic using take_pic node, find the lines of the grid, and output a new image withtred lines at the place of the grid lines
- Now calculate the center of each grid square using the grid lines and output a new image with the square centers in red + their position in pixels
- now create a double vector that represents the game grid and then calculate -based on the previous centers calculations- the intervals in x ans y in zhich a shape would be in so or so position in the grid
- Store a now check the grid and try to use opencv to recognize any circle
- same for cross
- now calculate the center of each of them
- then find to which grid sqware it is the most near and state in which position they are.
- then generate an order at a random position that isn't occupied
