- La detection cetait good le filter et tt mais j;ai fait en sorte de filtre que 
les lines qui etaient suffisamment proches les unes des autres en disant que si une 
line etait pas entre genre 50 et 200 a cote dune autre ba tu pouvait la jerter
- Then it was very hard to see the circles because HoughCircle was looking for perfect shit and stuff, then I found this thread:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9860667/writing-robust-color-and-size-invariant-circle-detection-with-opencv-based-on  
=> And tried MSER  (blob reco approach)  AND IT WORKED HELLLLA GOOD AND Actually detected both cross and circle centers
- Then I needed to separate Cross from circle.






- SO AS I WAS SAYING, The SIMULATION WAS WACKKKK WORKING because of my vision pipeline, SPECIFICALLY the shape detection, i.e template matching is dogshit as i saw on reddit,
  so even though i had not tried everything with it, tweak parameters for hours and so forth, this reddit comment got me thinking : "Useless to try to make this work if my goal is 
  real conditions you know.."
  => THUS i finished the pipeline, perception->minmax->move_orderer and moved on to the real robot for:
    * work directly on real conditions for perception
    * position/shape settings for real robot
    * Work in parallel on the web-Interface during wait-time for real-robot testing.


- I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SCRUCTURE FIRST LIKE THE NODE STRUCT FIRST THEN MOVE ON TO CODING YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE AVOIDED DATA PASSING FROM ONE PLACE BACK TO ANOTHER AND UNCLEANLINESS

- POUR LA DETECTION DES LIGNES CETAIT CA SON WORKFLOW:
Compact summary:
1. ROI mask - only detect lines in center 70% of image
2. Intersection-based - find where horizontal/vertical lines cross (not just individual lines)
3. Cluster intersections - merge nearby intersection points
4. Extract line positions - get unique h/v coordinates from intersections
5. Score pairs - prefer line pairs with reasonable spacing (80-300px) that are near image center
6. Pick best - return highest-scoring pair instead of just first 2
Key change: From "detect lines → cluster" to "detect lines → find intersections → cluster intersections → score geometry". More robust to noise.
